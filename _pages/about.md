I am a PhD candidate at TU Delft (The Netherlands) working in algorithms for **Integer Programming** under the supervision of [Karen Aardal](https://diamhomes.ewi.tudelft.nl/~kaardal/). My research lies at the intersection of **Optimization** and **Machine Learning**. I am interested in building **fast and adaptive algorithms** to solve pressing industrial and societal decision-making problems. I am also passionate about software development and baking! ü•ê

Before starting my PhD I obtained my Master's degree in Applied Mathematics at TU Delft (cum laude), and my Bachelor's degree in Physics at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.
